## ROBOTICS AND CONTROL OF BIOMEDICAL SYSTEMS
### Robotic arm Universal Robot UR5e
### Laboratory session 3: UR5e Social/Assistive robotic demonstration

---

The main objective of this laboratory session is to demonstrate the real-time execution of the assistive robotic tasks designed in the previous session using the UR5e robotic arm.

We can give you an exemple of a Social-Assistive task, such as a hand-shake or a give-me 5! task, which you can adapt to your own designed task.

**Laboratory development**

During the first hour of the laboratory session, students will finish and verify the real time execution of the assistive robotic tasks designed in the previous session. 

During the second hour, students will make a presentation of their Social-Assistive designed task.
